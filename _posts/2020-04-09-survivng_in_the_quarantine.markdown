Being in New Jersey it's kind of tough at the moment seeing as my state has the second most cases of Covid-19 in the country, but im still able to manage. My job has been shut down since March 15th so with that a lot of free time has opened up to dedicate to Flatiron. It's good during these times if you're stuck at home like me to keep your mind busy so you don't lose it. Keeping a good schedule is a must too because even im guilty of losing track of days and sleeping in a bit from late nights. However all of this free time has given me time to reflect on how I must adapt to keep my head on during these stressful times.
    Starting your morning early with a nice run or some brief exercise does wonders not only on your body, but your mind as well too! It can wake you up fully so you're ready to tackle the day with less stress and ready to take on any obstacle. As with programming you already know it doesn't come obstacle free, but every little win is a win in my book. Moral of the story its extremely important to stay active during these times while practicing safe social distancing. Stay home and use this time as a catch up and learn some more!
