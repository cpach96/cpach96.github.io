So comes the end of my Flatiron journey with the project to show off everything I have learned in the program. While difficult React and Redux showed a different side of Javacript I never knew existed. If you enjoy HTML syntax it will give you a leg up in the beginning due to the fact that JSX is a hybrid between traditional HTML with Javascript thrown into that mix. Everything from React and Redux has a specific flow of information that you can use to direct information between each component much like passing arguments into a function to hoist information from one place to another.
     The flow of the React model represents a tree handing down information from parent to child. You will have props that are produced by the top "Parent" and handed down to your child components. Understanding the flow early will help you better understand on how to give share properties to your components and keep your code clean and error free. With Redux you'll hear a lot about the "store" which is basically where you can separete your objects properties and keep them dynamic while reducing the component clutter. It also follows a specific flow which is crucial to know to keep your actions bug free and and keep your objects dynamic! Most important remember about async requests because they come into play big in Redux as well using them hand in hand with fetch. 
		 At last this is the moment ive been waiting for to show off all the skills learned while in Flatiron. I owe many thanks to the long hours of help from all my wonderful cohort leads and Flatiron staff. Though my journey has come to and end eveyone has left a lasting impression and I will not soon forget the time I spent here!
