Javascript was definitely an interesting module. A lot different from Ruby, however sharing some similarities I was able to navigate it! This doesn't go without saying it was easy this took my brain to a whole new limit of difficulty and at points I just wanted to quit. The most important points I would take away for people just starting this module is definitely stress the importance of reading the tests for the modules. Functions are similar to ruby methods, but more flexible which could lead to confusion from ruby's stricter rules were used to. Take notes and do not get down when something doesn't make sense. Going into my second to last project now I am prepared to take everything I know and put it to the test so I can make it to the last module!!
