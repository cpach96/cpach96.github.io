Javascript was definitely an interesting module. A lot different from Ruby, however sharing some similarities I was able to navigate it! This doesn't go without saying it was easy this took my brain to a whole new limit of difficulty and at points I just wanted to quit. The most important points I would take away for people just starting this module is definitely stress the importance of reading the tests for the modules. Functions are similar to ruby methods, but more flexible which could lead to confusion from ruby's stricter rules were used to. Take notes and do not get down when something doesn't make sense.
     The biggest piece of help I could give everyone who is going to be in my shoes soon is double down on your study the ES6 syntax it is your biggest fan to avoid repeating yourself and making functions of things that now already exist natively. For example in the new Class syntax you can create a method to append your object to the dom instead of having to declare new nodes over and over which will help you keep your code "DRY" and make it easier to understand. ES6 also includes a very VERY important function called an arrow function which which will help you keep your "context" and avoid nasty bugs with certain objects and variables not existing which has plagued me since the beginning of this module. Above all do not stress this module was a huge shift from ruby, but it all comes full circle using ruby to control the databases we've come to know and love and using javascript to help make it all look pretty and functional in the front end. Study up on Javascript and keep Ruby and Rails in your back pocket and you will have no issues at all in this module!!
