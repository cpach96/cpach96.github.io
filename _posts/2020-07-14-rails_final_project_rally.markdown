The rails project I can proudly has taken my brain to its limit! From being stuck with what I wanted to base my project on to spending hours debugging authentication I can come out with a victory. Every blog post I reflect on how I feel myself becoming more of a programmer, but after this project its finally hitting me that its real. Building an entire web application from front to back all by myself is a fantastic feeling seeing my complete work.
     The most important thing I can say looking back at the beginning of this unit is to take notes!! We basically started rails at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak and finding the time to concentrate with everything going was nearly impossible. After all the time passed I felt like I wasnt using my time constructively and let important details slip. Make sure to pay attention to the little details and dont get confused by rails magic! It may be magic, but the real magic is knowing the inner workings that makes it tick.
