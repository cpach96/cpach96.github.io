Before we start, Syntax is a word you're going to be hearing thrown around a lot. From making sure to include of you "ends" and closing those brackets and curly brackets make sure you pay attention to your syntax. Without proper syntax your code will end up broken and not working from the get go. Every beginning has an end as every parenthesis has a opening and a closing to contain every argument or string.

Procedural Ruby from any view is not an easy concept, but every passing test and every error solved will feel like a win in your book and you should feel proud. This is an integral stepping stone into your Software Engineering journey which will help build the blocks you need to move forward. If you grasp this concept the rest will all fall into place making you a much better and smoother programmer all together.
