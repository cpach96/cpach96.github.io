After finally putting the finishing touches on my first project I can say im ready for more! This project wrapped up the essentials of procedural ruby and object oriented in a nice bow. From learning on how to use my chosen API which helped seach a specific video game title and learn more about it to customizing the output with new gems it was a blast seeing what I could do. This was a significant milestone in my programming career because its your first time without knowing what errors to expect and your free project to choose and make it your own way!

After putting on the final touches you'll feel proud knowing what you created is your first original project that you completed on your own! It may not be a large project, but from where I was this time in January to today it is a huge step in my career and a huge boost in my morale knowing I didn't give up and was able to complete it. I will keep pushing even harder in the next section and keep learning to make my next project even more impressive than this one!
