Reflecting after finishing this project we have all came such a long way since beginning this program! From struggling on my first methods to finishing a website from front to back-end in only 4 months time really is a feat in and of itself. While working on this project I noticed some times I just needed to sit back and say wow im really doing this and its all of my own work. Not to mention with the quarantine still going on keeping a level head during this chaos has been difficult. 
     I based this project as a branch off my previous CLI gem project which helped me come up with ideas quicker since I had a ton for that project left over. Now that im finished here I have tons of ideas for the next project once it is time and can incorporate this one into it. Having my projects grow from each one is an awesome way to see how my knowlege is growing month by month. Remember Rome wasn't built in a day coding is not easy nor is it a race. If you try hard enough you will learn and you will finish!
